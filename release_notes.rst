Release Notes
=============

Version 2024.12
---------------

This is the first official release of the Raivin Perception Platform.

For Maivin users this software release is a major upgrade which unifies the Torizon for Maivin
branches of Raivin and Maivin into a single software release.  As part of this release the version
naming has been updated to follow the YEAR.MONTH.PATCH format instead of using the Torizon version
number as the base.  The upstream Torizon OS version number is documented in the release notes.
