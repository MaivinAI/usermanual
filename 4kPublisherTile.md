# 4K Tile Stitching Documentation

## Overview

The Maivin Publisher now supports automatic 4K tile stitching for MCAP files containing 4 individual camera tiles. When 4 tile topics are detected in an MCAP file, the system automatically stitches them into a single 4K (3840x2160) image and uses these stitched images in the ZIP export instead of individual tile images.

## How It Works

### 1. Tile Detection

The system automatically detects when all 4 required tile topics are present in the MCAP file:

- `/camera/h264/tl` (Top Left)
- `/camera/h264/tr` (Top Right) 
- `/camera/h264/bl` (Bottom Left)
- `/camera/h264/br` (Bottom Right)

Each topic must contain H.264 encoded video data.

### 2. Tile Processing Pipeline

```
MCAP File → H.264 Decode → Tile Stitching → 4K JPEG → ZIP Export
```

#### Step 1: H.264 Decoding
- Each tile is decoded from H.264 to RGB using stream accumulation
- Handles partial frames and keyframe detection
- Maintains separate decoders for each tile position
- Uses fallback frames when decode fails

#### Step 2: Tile Stitching
- Combines 4 individual 1920x1080 tiles into one 3840x2160 image
- Arranges tiles in 2x2 grid:
  ```
  [TopLeft]    [TopRight]
  [BottomLeft] [BottomRight]
  ```
- Creates high-quality JPEG output (85% quality)

#### Step 3: ZIP Integration
- Stitched 4K images replace individual tile images in ZIP export
- Uses sequential matching (stitched frame 0 → sample 0, etc.)
- Falls back to original images when no stitched frames available

## Usage

### Command Line

```bash
sudo ./edgefirst-publisher zip --out test your_file.mcap
```

The system automatically detects tile topics and switches to stitching mode - no additional flags required.

### Output

When tile stitching is active, you'll see logs like:
```
[INFO] Successfully created 198 stitched 4K frames
[INFO] Using stitched frame 0 for sample 0 (timestamp: 4037102265000)
[INFO] Using stitched frame 1 for sample 1 (timestamp: 4037140961000)
```

## Technical Details

### Tile Positioning

```rust
TilePosition::TopLeft     → (0, 0)
TilePosition::TopRight    → (1920, 0)
TilePosition::BottomLeft  → (0, 1080)
TilePosition::BottomRight → (1920, 1080)
```

### Image Processing

- **Input**: 4x H.264 encoded tiles (1920x1080 each)
- **Processing**: H.264 decode → RGB → Stitching → JPEG encode
- **Output**: Single 4K JPEG (3840x2160)

### Memory Management

- Stream accumulation for H.264 decoding
- Automatic cleanup of old incomplete frames
- Efficient memory usage with frame buffering

## Performance

### Processing Speed
- Typical processing: ~200-400 frames per second
- Memory usage: Optimized with stream accumulation
- Disk I/O: Minimal - processes in memory

### Quality Settings
- JPEG quality: 85% (configurable)
- Color space: RGB
- Compression: Optimized for quality/size balance

## Error Handling

### Decode Failures
- Uses fallback frames from previous successful decode
- Continues processing other tiles
- Logs warnings for failed tiles

### Missing Tiles
- Processes available tiles (partial stitching)
- Logs information about missing tile positions
- Graceful degradation

### Timestamp Mismatches
- Uses sequential matching instead of timestamp-based matching
- Handles different time bases between samples and video frames
- Robust fallback to original images

## Configuration

### Tile Topics
The system looks for these specific topic names:
```rust
let tile_topics = [
    "/camera/h264/tl",
    "/camera/h264/tr", 
    "/camera/h264/bl",
    "/camera/h264/br",
];
```

### Frame Processing
- **Cleanup threshold**: 1000ms (incomplete frames older than 1 second are discarded)
- **Force process threshold**: 100ms (frames with 3+ tiles are processed after 100ms)
- **Accumulation limit**: 200KB per tile (prevents memory issues)

## File Structure

### Source Files
- `src/tile_stitcher.rs` - Main stitching logic
- `src/zip.rs` - ZIP export integration
- `src/main.rs` - CLI integration

### Key Functions
- `has_tile_topics()` - Detects if all 4 tile topics are present
- `process_mcap_tiles_for_zip()` - Processes tiles and creates stitched frames
- `write_all_with_stitched_images()` - ZIP export with stitched images

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Empty ZIP file**: Usually indicates timestamp mismatch - fixed with sequential matching
2. **Missing tiles**: Check that all 4 tile topics are present and contain H.264 data
3. **Decode errors**: May indicate corrupted H.264 data or missing keyframes

### Debug Logging

Enable debug logging to see detailed processing information:
```bash
RUST_LOG=debug sudo ./edgefirst-publisher zip --out test your_file.mcap
```

### Performance Issues

- Large MCAP files may take time to process
- Memory usage scales with number of concurrent frames
- Consider processing in smaller chunks for very large files

## Future Enhancements

- Configurable tile topic names
- Support for different tile arrangements
- Real-time stitching mode
- Quality settings via command line
- Support for other output formats (PNG, etc.)

## Dependencies

- `openh264` - H.264 decoding
- `image` - JPEG encoding
- `turbojpeg` - Image compression
- `zip` - ZIP file creation
- `mcap` - MCAP file parsing
