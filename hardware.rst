Hardware
========

The Maivin Perception Platform is available in two configurations: Maivin and Raivin.  The Maivin
configuration is a vision-only platform while the Raivin configuration includes an integrated radar
module.  The Raivin configuration is built on the core Maivin configuration and both run the same
software stack.  The Raivin configuration also runs the additional radar and sensor fusion software.

The Maivin configuration provides a vision-based perception stack for use in harsh environments, 
providing an IP66/67 waterproof enclosure and connectors.  The Maivin platform is built on the NXP 
i.MX 8M Plus processor which includes a 2-TOPS AI accelerator.  The Maivin Perception stack leverages
the AI-accelerator enabling this vision sensor to be deployed in the field to deliver real-time edge 
perception applications.

The Raivin configuration further extends the perception capabilities of the platform through the addition 
of the integrated radar module.  The Maivin Perception Stack is augmented for Raivin configurations with 
the RadarExp Fusion Model which provides low-level radar data fusion with the vision data.  The low-level 
radar data is reprensented as the range and doppler data cube, the RadarExp module fuses this data with 
the vision data to provide a more robust perception stack.  The traditional point-cloud data from the 
radar is also available for use by the Raivin perception stack, and is especially useful for augmenting 
the object detection and tracking capabilities through the additional parameters offered by the point 
cloud data.  

Further details on the RadarExp Fusion Model can be found in the Maivin Model Optimization Guide.  Details
of recording and annotating radar-vision datasets can be found in the Raivin Dataset Tool User Manual.
